## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Enter a new task in the input field at the top of the page (e.g., "Read Chapter 3").
3.  Click "Add Task" to add it to your list.
4.  To mark a task as complete, check its checkbox next to it.
5.  To delete a task, click on its corresponding "Delete" link next to it.

**Saving and Loading Tasks**

- Click "Save Tasks to Local Storage" after adding or completing some work on your list so you can retrieve them later even if you close your browser!
- Use "Load Tasks from Local Storage" when starting up again; this will populate everything back onto screen just like before!

**Clearing Data**

- If desired at any point during use - simply hit either button labeled 'Clear' near bottom right corner below other controls â€“ one removes only stored info while another wipes out ALL locally saved items entirely!
